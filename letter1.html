        <p>고생했다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ You got through the first mission very very well. Very impressed. Remember the access code “prudent” so next time if you want to read this you don’t have to do everything again. You could also just copy and paste the url of this site and it should take you to this letter.
        <br><br>There isn’t much I want to say except thank you. Thank you for taking time to call me every day even though you’re busy. Thank you for calling me 오빠 and 어흥 and giving me the best hugs I’ve ever had. Thank you for giving me fruits and veggies and UK snacks and eating my favorite foods with me. Thank you for hugging me and encouraging me before my 독주회. Thank you for being my moral support. Thank you for smiling when you see me, and smiling when you can’t see me; for crying for me in that bus station; for laughing at my stupid jokes even when it really isn’t funny and you want to make me feel better; for making that 흥 표정 when you want to make me feel better. Thank you for waiting for me in front of my house, in your room, in a bus station, in your airplane, in your dreams. Thank you for the tea in your Starbucks tumbler. Thank you for your earphones, and your ears that listen to everything I say and everything I don’t say that you somehow understand from just looking at me. Thank you for everything you’ve done, everything you’ll do, and your chemistry tutor sessions.
        <br><br>Sometimes when I’m doing anything random, I sometimes stop and think, *What would Jinny do in this situation? How would she navigate through this and make the wisest decision?* I adore you and 아껴 you but also I respect you so much. You are genuinely one of the most prudent, wise, humble, patient, and brilliant people I know and every time I see a couple or any girls in general I just think, *yeah they’re all kids compared to Jinny.* I’m starting to confuse myself with what I’m saying right now, but my point is that you are my role model and 존경 you so much. The pastor told us a verse from the bible that reminded me of you today. I forgot the line but he said something about finding a woman with wisdom. THATS YOU !
        <br><br>Whenever I really miss you, I’ll write more letters in this website so you can read it whenever you want. Not for free of course. I’ll make some other things for you to do to read the rest of the letters.
        <br><br>I’ll end this off with a poem because you like poems. The last time I wrote a poem was in middle school so I hope you understand. Thanks for reading all this I LOVE YOU SM
