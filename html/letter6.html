    <h1>HAPPY 200 DAYSSSS</h1>
    <p>CONGRATSSSSSSS JINNYY&nbsp;<br /><br />Already 200 days passed. (well, by the time I&rsquo;m writing this letter it&rsquo;s like a week later but we don&rsquo;t talk about that) What the heck?? I swear 100 days was like yesterday. Time feels like it&rsquo;s just going by so fast but at the same time it feels like we&rsquo;ve been together for an eternity. How paradoxical. That word reminds me of you sometimes. Your emotional maturity, your intellectual processes. Sometimes I wonder, what goes on your head when you can just talk to my mum so comfortably like that? When you console your friends? When you put your QR code FACING UP on the PASSPORT READER? I think you know this already but I had to tell you once again. One of the many reasons why I am that attracted to you.<br /><br />Once again you&rsquo;ve gone to the states to study but this time I think I feel less anxious than before. We&rsquo;ve already gone through this once. Second time is light work. Because I know the waiting will be worth it at the end when you get a job and make food for me while I clean the house. I think we might look back and think that it&rsquo;ll all been worth it. Being physically together would be so much better yeah, but I&rsquo;m not scared in the slightest. I am scared of studying though oh my DAYS I&rsquo;m cooked<br /><br />Whenever you want me to do anything for you while you&rsquo;re there, you need to tell me. Or at least hint at it. I&rsquo;ll give you some examples. I can (or at least I can try my best to):<br />- play you a lullaby to sleep<br />- encourage you to eat chocolate<br />- play videogames with you<br />- teach you t-spin setups<br />- watch movies with you<br />- try to fix your sleep schedule<br />- remind you to eat<br />- call you<br />- wish you goodnight<br />- read with you<br />- make you laugh<br />- say comforting words<br />- recommend you fire pieces/songs<br />- listen to anything you want to say<br />- daydream with you<br />- keep you from being bored<br />- help you concentrate<br />- study with you<br />- love you<br />among others. So PLEASE use me like a fat slave.&nbsp;<br /><br />I will update this website more now that I have nothing to do since you&rsquo;re in the states DW I DIDN&rsquo;T FORGET ABOUT THIS. Once again, CONGRATS ON 200 DAYS!!!! It is and always will be a privilege to be your boyfriend and slave and pig and leftovers bin and tetris coach. If you remember, I said that this poem reminded me of you. I want to share it with you again.<br /><br /><b>If I can stop one heart from breaking</b> <br />by Emily Dickinson<br /><br />If I can stop one heart from breaking,<br />I shall not live in vain;<br />If I can ease one life the aching,<br />Or cool one pain,<br />Or help one fainting robin<br />Unto his nest again,<br />I shall not live in vain.</p>
    <p>Also here is the lullaby for when I can't play you live: <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/RhD4B5XXZZpBcuv5WW">https://on.soundcloud.com/RhD4B5XXZZpBcuv5WW</a> </p>
