      <p>Heyy pompom 여기 읽은지 꽤 됐지..ㅎㅎ 미안.! I felt like I haven&rsquo;t done this in too long and also I&rsquo;ll probably get busier soon so I decided to write you a letter. Congrats on finishing this bs crossword btw LMAO as of writing this I don&rsquo;t even know if this is possible to complete without any clues. If you do manage to figure it out, YOU&rsquo;RE SO SMART MY MENSA POMPOM ok I&rsquo;ll stop saying POMPOM<br /><br />When I was making this, I kept thinking about what you told me that night: the small, consistent things matter more. The letters are great and all, but the small things I do every day matter more, you said. Well, I&rsquo;m writing a letter right now and it reminded me of how I neglect the little things. As soon as we started calling today (Jan 30 for me, Jan 29 night for you) I just knew I was being really cold and dry and sounded even reluctant to call you. I know I said I would be more consistent last time but I realize now that I did not live up to my words. If I do that again, can you tell me like on the spot.? I know you shouldn&rsquo;t have to but if I&rsquo;m just being annoying you got to. Yeah just in general if I&rsquo;m being annoying pleaseee tell me to stop being annoying because x. If you don&rsquo;t want to you don&rsquo;t have to of course. But if you ever wanted to but felt like I would get pissed or something, know that I would 오히려 be grateful.<br /><br />Speaking of being grateful, I&rsquo;m just so grateful that you spend time with me and do things that I want to even though you might find it boring. Playing Tetris with me?? Chess??? Dealing with my dumbass on Minecraft?????? Like, what am I doing???? But you listen to me always and make me feel like pro even though I&rsquo;m absolute dog crap. I&rsquo;m just really really grateful for you for that.<br /><br />Once I go to Australia next week, I&rsquo;ll send you photos and videos and my room and buildings and food and my mum and seagulls and I&rsquo;ll call you. You need to be my friend okay?? I will probably be gone for a long time when I&rsquo;m looking at houses or buying stuff with my mum but just know that I&rsquo;m probably thinking something like<br />- Would Jinny approve of these avocados I&rsquo;m buying?<br />- Would she think that this house is ass? Good enough? Nono she would look at me with that side eye and disapprove<br />- I want to swim on that beach with her<br />- I wonder if she&rsquo;s awake yet<br />okay???<br /><br />I&rsquo;ll try my best. I really will. We WILL achieve the dream house we designed. We just need to wait a bit for our wealth to accumulate. But I think that will be easy based on the hoarding I&rsquo;ve seen while we play videogames and also the amount of coins you just randomly have on you. So just don&rsquo;t die and lose half our platinum okay???<br /><br />I love you more than I love #9 chords (HUGE COMPLIMENT) and thank you for being my girlfrienddd</p>
