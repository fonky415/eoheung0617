      <p>hihi Jinny this may have taken you many tries or it may have taken you 3 minutes. Regardless, congrats!! You need to study and so I’ll make the letter short. It’s been some time since I updated this and I haven’t been diligent even though I’ve had all the time of my life these days. I’ll be more productive from now and not waste time.</p>
      <p>I just want to let you know that you are doing so well and I could not be more proud of you for going strong even though you’ll probably feeling tired and burnt out and everything. I could never understand what you’re going through as an unemployed guy playing league but I just know that it’s super hard and I respect you a lot for studying and eating food and even buying yourself chocolate because you craved it. Also hitting the gym consistently is so hard but you’re doing it so I respect that so much as well. Just a bit more until your surprise...! 기대하고 있을게ㅋㅋㅋㅋ</p>
      <p>Thanks for being part of my life I MISS YOU SO MUCH</p>
