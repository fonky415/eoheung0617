        <h1>My second letter</h1>
        <section>
        <p>It’s been a while since I wrote you a letter. And a lot has happened since then. I’m leaving the states?? 
            When I just got here and got used to long distance in same timezone??? It’s already midterms for you??? 
            It feels like time is going too fast for me to keep up and I’m losing my breath. But I feel like writing 
            this letter is helping me pause for a second and think about you, our relationship, and what I want to 
            say to you.</p>

    <p>And yes I know you have midterms so I will be considerate and keep it short.</p>

    <p>Despite having to live:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>12085 kilometers</li>
      <li>18 hours</li>
      <li>2 oceans</li>
      <li>14 time zones</li>
      <li>2 seasons</li>
      <li>93 countries</li>
      <li>3 tectonic plates</li>
      <li>6,500 nautical miles</li>
      <li>1 × 10⁻⁶ AU</li>
      <li>100 hops and 2 undersea cables</li>
    </ul>

    <p>apart from each other, I’m still confident that we’ll get through it and we’ll talk every day and I’ll trust 
        you and love the same. I feel like I should be more scared or apprehensive, but 이상하게도 I have this 확신 that you 
        would always be there for me and that makes me feel so nice. I wish I could do the same for you, so you need 
        to tell me if you don’t feel like that way. But don’t worry—at least for the next 3 months, I will always be 
        free when you’re free since I’ll be free 24/7.</p>

    <p>And regarding your future studies and med school and asking your mum and everything, don’t worry. 하나님이 다 
        해결해 주실 거야. Just do what feels right for you and it’ll work out at the end of the day. It’ll still be hard
         and stressful but it’ll work out at the end so don’t worry. 노 걱정 ㅇㅋ? If you ever need someone to listen to you 고민 
         even if I’m probably not qualified to provide actual advice, I’ll always be there for you. Why? Because I 
         know that if I had any 고민s, you would do the same. But also provide solid advice. I’m not confident about that
          last part yet.</p>

    <p>You reminded me of this song by Stevie Wonder called <em>You Are the Sunshine of My Life</em>. Because you are.</p><br>

    <p>You are the sunshine of my life<br>
    That's why I'll always be around<br>
    You are the apple of my eye<br>
    Forever you'll stay in my heart</p>

    <p>I feel like this is the beginning<br>
    Though I've loved you for a million years<br>
    And if I thought our love was ending<br>
    I'd find myself drowning in my own tears, whoa, oh, oh</p>

    <p>You are the sunshine of my life, yeah<br>
    That's why I'll always stay around, mmm, mmm, yeah, yeah<br>
    You are the apple of my eye<br>
    Forever you'll stay in my heart</p>

    <p>You must have known that I was lonely<br>
    Because you came to my rescue<br>
    And I know that this must be heaven<br>
    How could so much love be inside of you?<br>
    Whoa, whoa</p>

    <p>You are the sunshine of my life, yeah<br>
    That's why I'll always stay around, mmm (baby)<br>
    You are the apple of my eye<br>
    Forever you'll stay in my heart, yeah</p>

    <p>You are the sunshine of my life, baby<br>
    That's why I'll always stay around</p><br>
    
    <p>I love you and hope you get all the questions right on your midtermsss !!!! YOU GOT THIS</p>

    <br><br><p>- Phillip</p><br>
