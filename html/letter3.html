        Hey Jinnyyyy I know it’s been a while since the last one but better late than never! After calling you yesterday I felt really stupid because I literally couldn’t say anything but just stare at you. Not even like “it’s going to be alright” or “I’m so sorry” because that just felt kind of empty compared to the weight of what you’re going through. And I don’t even know how it feels to even be in your situation.

        Circumstances might be against you, like that stupid website not working or the 한도 being 100만원 and even some people like your mum might be just really uncooperative and frustrating, but just know that there’re even more people on your side that really really want you to be well and happy. Let’s imagine the worse worse case scenario. You get deported and your mum kicks you out and you lose all your money and you’re on the streets. It’s fine. Your uncle will pick you up. My mum will let you in our house. My dad will take us to very good restaurants. My aunt will buy you really pretty clothes. Heck, Mr. and Ms. Charrier will give you tea and inspirational Instagram messages. Of course, this worse case scenario will most likely not happen, but even if it did, you’ll be safe and fine and loved. I’ve still love you the same no matter what happens and be on your side. Ok??

        Also thank you for still being so nice to me even though you’re going through a lot right now. Whenever you need to crash out or even get pissed at someone for no reason, I’ll be there for you. LOVE YOU
