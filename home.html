    <p class="muted">Through laggy Facetime calls, VERY close calls, late humid hot walks, my completely oblivious dumbass, 
      an impossibly hard puzzle, and a lot of love, you have successfully made it past 100 days with Phillip! Congrats!! 
      <br><br>I've never felt so appreciated, so heard, so loved in my life, and I'm so grateful for that. But that's in the letters that you'll read later. You gave yours for free, but you're gonna have to EARN my letters.
      <br><br>For each letter, you need to complete a task. If you complete it successfully, then perhaps you'll be able to read something I wrote for you.
      <br><br>Good luck!ㅎㅎ</p>
